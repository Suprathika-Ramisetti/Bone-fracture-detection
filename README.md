**Bone Fracture Detection System using Deep Learning**

This is a mini project completed during my college coursework, designed to detect bone fractures from X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

**Abstract**

Bone fractures are common injuries, and early, accurate detection is important for effective treatment. This project uses a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically analyze X-ray images and classify them as fractured or not fractured. The system also provides a probability rate indicating the modelâ€™s confidence in its prediction.

**Technologies Used**

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

**Input and Output**

Input:

X-ray image of a bone

Output:

Prediction: 'Fractured' or 'Not Fractured'

Probability Rate: Confidence score in percentage (for example: 94.75%)

**Execution**

1.Clone the repository

  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bone-fracture-detection.git
  
  cd bone-fracture-detection
  
2.Install required libraries
  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3.Run the notebook

Open bone_fracture_detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the cells.

**Features**

1.X-ray image preprocessing using OpenCV

2.Automatic feature extraction using CNN

3.Predicts whether a bone is fractured or not

4.Displays probability (confidence) rate of prediction

5.Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and visual analysis

**Learnings**

-Developed a CNN-based deep learning model for medical image classification

-Learned X-ray image preprocessing and enhancement techniques

-Implemented confidence-based predictions for real-time fracture detection

-Improved skills in model evaluation and result visualization
